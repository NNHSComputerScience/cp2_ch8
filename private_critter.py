# Private Critter
# Demonstrates private attributes and private methods
#   To encourage encapsulation, you can declare attributes or methods as 'private',
#   meaning only other methods of the object should access or invoke it.
#   However, privacy is only a convention in Python; there is no true privacy
#   as in other languages.
